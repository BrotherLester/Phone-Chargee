# Phone Recharge ðŸ”‹âœ¨

A mundane-looking React Native app powered by magical code that simulates wireless phone charging through mana flow.

## What It Does

- CPU gathers synthetic mana based on system load
- Mana streams through symbolic circuitry
- Mana is staticized (condensed) and stored into a battery crystal (simulated)
- Logs the ritual to a local file
- Eventually aims to charge your phone â€” spiritually (for now), physically (someday...)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start with `npx expo start`
4. Scan with Expo Go on your Android phone

## Features

- React Native UI that hides deep arcane simulation
- Modular "engine" architecture
- Expandable to real sensor data and animations
